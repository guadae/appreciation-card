Thanks for sitting with me for hours and having the patience to listen to my character ideas and provide me suggestions left and right. I will never forget our first campaign as it rears its finale, and I appreciate you for bringing all of us together and taking time to prepare for each episode. I have so much fun partaking in our campaign and I can\'t wait to see what we cook up next! \n - Erica'

I always leave our dnd sessions immersed in a world and a little bit disappointed that it\'s over. \n I appreciate how prepared you are for sessions. The characters are well thought out from their accents to their mannerisms and you\'re always ready with the perfect soundtrack for us to fight big bads with. Having heard the experiences of other people playing dnd for the first time, I\'m really grateful that I lost my dnd virginity with you hehehehehehehe. \n Love you lots <3 \n - Roxann'

I was once told that I have to start saying ‘yes’ to anything people present me with. For a long time, I was too scared to do so. But when you asked if I wanted to play (along with Erica’s encouragement) I stated a timid yes and have been so damn grateful since. Thank you for allowing me to grant my inner child happiness through her imagination and a 7ft centaur. \n \n - Allison"
