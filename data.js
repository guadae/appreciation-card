Thanks for sitting with me for hours and having the patience to listen to my character ideas and provide me suggestions left and right. I will never forget our first campaign as it rears its finale, and I appreciate you for bringing all of us together and taking time to prepare for each episode. I have so much fun partaking in our campaign and I can\'t wait to see what we cook up next! \n - Erica'

Your creativity and sheer enthusiasm have fueled so much of my writing and world-building, and I can\'t thank you enough for that.\n The sessions have been beyond entertaining—they\’re immersive, engaging, and have given me the chance to see people\’s personalities in a whole new light. I\'ve always wanted to create something alongside a team, and now, thanks to you, I\'m actually doing it. That means a lot. \n Not only have you given me a platform to express my creativity, but you\'ve also provided a space where I can refine and perfect it. Because of your support, I\’ve been able to accomplish more than I ever thought possible. I\’ve found my calling, and your encouragement has played a huge role in that. The skills that I have grown in the book I\'ve been writing is the best thing I could have asked for. \n - Kyle"

The characters are well thought out from their accents to their mannerisms and you\'re always ready with the perfect soundtrack for us to fight big bads with. Having heard the experiences of other people playing dnd for the first time, I\'m really grateful that I lost my dnd virginity with you hehehehehehehe. \n Love you lots <3 \n - Roxann'

I was once told that I have to start saying ‘yes’ to anything people present me with. For a long time, I was too scared to do so. But when you asked if I wanted to play (along with Erica’s encouragement) I stated a timid yes and have been so damn grateful since. Thank you for allowing me to grant my inner child happiness through her imagination and a 7ft centaur. \n \n - Allison"
