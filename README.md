# Appreciation Card 

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules. This site is inspired by heartfelt appreciation for a close friend that enjoys DMing. I used React, Vite, CSS & CSS Grid, and Javascript to create this site. I also drew and colored the characters using Procreate and Photoshop. All ownership of each character belongs to their respective owners. I do not own any of these characters; these are purely fanart of them from our sessions.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
